# Hi there!

My name is Rodrigo Carvajal and I am an astrophysicist working at the Instituto de Astrofísica e Ciências do Espaço in the University of Lisbon, Portugal.

I work on the study of detection indicators for Radio Galaxies and their physical properties with the use of Machine Learning techniques.
